Mostly code from a javaScript snake game tutorial by @ Kenny Yip Coding on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baBq5GAL0_U) that I followed along with and modified while I was learning javaScript, HTML, and CSS during the summer. The HTML and CSS code create a webpage that is a part of my "Virtual Arcade" project that I worked on over the summer with the goal of learning about web development
